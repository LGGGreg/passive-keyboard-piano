# passive-keyboard-piano
Turns your entire keyboard into a scalable piano

This is a simple c# application that I made by the request of sakura.

It is mainly for novelty purposes.

This Program's Purpose is to turn the majority of your keyboard into a piano. It uses the horizontal positioning of the US keyboard to determine the pitch of the midi sound to be played. It is designed to be minimized and to work with other programs open.
